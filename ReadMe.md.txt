# The Pig Game 

Class project with, as always, a few personal touches to try out new things.

## Getting Started

Rules:

ENG:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a pair of dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, on any of the dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
